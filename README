fixed_point is a python module for fixed-point arithmetic, implemented as
an extension of deModel.  To run the examples ('examples_fixed_point.py'),
the folder fixed_point/ must be visible from the PYTHONPATH.

Complex multiplication using the class 'fixed_point.ComplexFixedInt' has 
been verified as bit-accurate against XSG. Bit-accurate rounding is still
to be implemented.
